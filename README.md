Cinema Ticket
This project is a cinema ticket reservation system implemented in Python. It allows users to create accounts, manage their profiles, view available movie sessions, and reserve seats. The system also supports different subscription types and offers various discounts based on user's membership duration and birthday.

Features
User registration with mandatory birthdate
Automatic registration date storage
Users can have multiple bank accounts
Bank accounts support deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations
Enhanced security with account password and CVV2
Users can charge their wallet and purchase different subscription types
Bronze: Basic default service with no special benefits
Silver: 20% cashback on the next three purchases
Gold: 50% cashback and a free energy drink for one month
Users can view and reserve movie sessions
Birthday discounts and membership-based discounts
Restrictions on reserving past sessions or sessions with full capacity
Age restrictions on viewing and reserving movies for higher age ratings
Separate script for cinema managers to set up movie sessions
Two approaches for differentiating managers and users:
Using an Enum field in the User model class
Inheriting from an abstract base Human model
Modular design with separate modules for each functionality
Test-driven development (TDD) using a tests package
Custom exceptions and exception handling
Logging events in cinematicket.log
Data persistence using Pickle or JSON files
Recommended Git Workflow for team collaboration
Additional features are acceptable after completing the main scenario
